## Technology choices 

We chose to use React-native because it is a cross-platform language that facilitates the development of the app and allows us to go faster.

We use Redux to manage the state of the app and we make the store persistent with a specific library of Redux. Redux allows us to well manage the data in the app and to easily have persistent data for the offline mode.  

To make the data persistent we use the Async Storage system because it is an asynchronous and persistent storage adapt to React native platform.  Moreover, it is a popular storage so a lot of documentation and tutorials exist to help us. Moreover, it is well adapted to our case because it is a key-value storage so it is adapted to store the state of the application.
